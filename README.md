# Purpose

This repository is a proto-repository ("DNA") for building an application with a coding agent.
It defines clear workflows and reusable instructions so agent-driven work stays consistent as the project grows.

# Scope

- Collaboration workflows (threads) for agent-driven development
- Agent rules and routing (`AGENTS.md`, `docs-ai/agents-core-knowledge/roots.md`)
- Procedural skills (`.codex/skills/`)
- Agent knowledge and project knowledge (`docs-ai/`)
- Human-facing documentation (`docs/`)
