# docs-ai/agents-core-knowledge/repository-layout.md

## Agent summary

- Fast placement index: where to find things and where to put new things.
- This doc answers "where?"; constraints and governance live in `KB_REPOSITORY_RULES`.

## Current root layout (what limits search)

| Path | What it contains | Use when you need... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` | Root rules + routing | non-negotiables and which KB doc to consult |
| `scripts/` | Canonical scripts | repeatable repo workflows (git helpers, dev/up/down, etc.) |
| `docs-ai/` | Agent knowledge, prompts, artifacts, and project docs | any agent workflow, prompt, artifact, or project state |
| `.codex/skills/` | Procedural skills | a repeatable multi-step procedure (`$<skill>`) |
| `docs/` | Human-facing docs | application development guidance and collaboration docs |
| `frontend/` | Frontend runtime boundary | the user-facing web/mobile client code (`frontend/web`, when it exists) |
| `frontend/web` | Web application | primary React UI runtime boundary |
| `ai/` | AI runtime boundaries (placeholders) | orchestrator/embeddings services (when they exist) |
| `supabase/` | Supabase boundary (placeholder) | DB migrations, Edge Functions, RLS policies (when adopted) |
| `infra/` | Infrastructure boundary (placeholder) | deploy templates, local stack definitions (when adopted) |

## Adding a new runtime/service (folder placement + naming cues)

This repo grows by adding services. Use these naming cues to keep the tree predictable (constraints are in `KB_REPOSITORY_RULES`):

1. Pick the runtime root by what it is:
   - user-facing app -> `frontend/<app>`
   - AI runtime -> `ai/<service>`
   - DB-adjacent (migrations/functions/policies) -> `supabase/`
   - infra/deploy/local stack -> `infra/`
   - non-AI API/service -> `backend/<service>` (create `backend/` only when it becomes real)
2. Name by role, not technology:
   - prefer: `web`, `api`, `worker`, `orchestrator`, `embeddings`
   - avoid: `react`, `node`, `python`, `express`
3. If a new service is expected to become a permanent runtime boundary, create it under the correct root and keep it self-contained.

---

## Expected next folders as real code appears (not present yet)

These are common additions as the proto-repo becomes a real application:

- `shared/` (contracts and schemas shared across services)
- `backend/` (non-AI API/services)
- `config/` (global defaults/templates, if needed beyond service-local config)
- `tests/` (cross-service test suites, if needed)
