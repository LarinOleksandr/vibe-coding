This file is the **hard constraints** list.

If something is written here, it is a "must not break" contract.

## How to update this file

- Add or change a contract only with explicit user approval.
- Keep each contract short and testable.
- If a contract changes, add a short note to `DOC_PROJECT_INSIGHTS` explaining why.
