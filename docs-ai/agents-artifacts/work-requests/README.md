# Work Requests

This folder stores Requests created from Ideas during `$review-ideas`.

## What is a Request

A Request is a classified work item that you can point to when starting a normal thread and invoking the right existing skill (for example `$feature-development`, `$bug-fix`, `$code-refactoring`).

## Structure

- `REQ-*.md` - Requests

## Rules

- Requests created from Ideas must include `source_idea: docs/ideas/<file>.md` in frontmatter.
- This is an agent artifact folder and is meant to be committed.
