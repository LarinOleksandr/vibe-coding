# Conversations (opt-in)

Use this folder when you want to save a short, searchable summary of a valuable discussion.

## What goes here

- `YYYY-MM-DD__<thread-code>__<slug>.summary.md` — committed, short, curated memory.
- `YYYY-MM-DD__<thread-code>__<slug>.transcript.md` — optional full transcript (ignored by default via `.gitignore`).

## Keep it safe

- Do not store secrets or private data in committed files.
- Prefer adding durable decisions to `DOC_PROJECT_INSIGHTS` and link the summary from there.
