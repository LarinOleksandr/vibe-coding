# Conversations Index

This folder holds **opt-in** conversation summaries for long-term memory (created via `$conversation-save`).

Rules:

- Create a summary only when the user asks to save a conversation.
- Keep summaries short and searchable.
- Do not commit full transcripts by default (see `.gitignore`).
