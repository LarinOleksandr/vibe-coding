# Save Action (Save as Idea)

## Goal

Save what the user said as an Idea in `docs/ideas/`.

## Output

- A new Markdown file under `docs/ideas/`

## Workflow

1. Create a new idea file in `docs/ideas/`.
   - Any name is allowed.
   - Use a safe default name:
     - `idea-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<slug>.md`
2. Write the content:
   - date/time
   - the user’s verbatim text (do not summarize)
3. Report back the file path.
