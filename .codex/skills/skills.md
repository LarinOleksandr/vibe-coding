## Skills

- `$api-endpoint-development` - Add or modify an API / Edge Function endpoint with explicit contracts, validation, and safe integration.
- `$app-design-setup` - Initialize or update the `frontend/web` design system using a shadcn preset, in a consistent and repeatable way.
- `$architecture-review` - Check a proposed change for architectural compliance, surface conflicts, and propose compliant alternatives.
- `$bug-fix` - Diagnose and fix bugs or regressions. Use when a user reports broken or incorrect behavior, tests fail due to a defect, or a bug fix is requested.
- `$code-refactoring` - Perform a structural change without altering external behavior.
- `$code-review` - Perform a focused Codex review of the PR diff (token-efficient) and report blockers, important risks, and missing tests.
- `$coding-standards-check` - Use when reviewing changes for coding standards, consistency, and basic maintainability.
- `$context-maintenance` - Maintain project documentation, agent knowledge, and methodology; keep routes consistent and remove duplication.
- `$context-load` - Use when a quick, baseline repo context snapshot and routing map are needed before deeper work.
- `$db-migration` - Evolve Supabase schema and data without breaking contracts or RLS.
- `$design-review` - Review UX/flow decisions and propose improvements (timeboxed; artifact-based).
- `$documents-export` - Export validated agent outputs into user-facing documents (PDF, DOCX, JSON, MD) in a reproducible and safe way.
- `$feature-commit` - Use when saving current work into a single feature commit and selecting the next roadmap item.
- `$feature-development` - Manage feature development readiness. Use when a user requests a new feature or behavior change, including short or vague requests that need structured clarification.
- `$feature-research` - Produce a timeboxed research brief to surface risks, constraints, and decisions before planning.
- `$feature-start` - Use when starting a feature thread and you need the current project context, insights, and roadmap before implementation.
- `$new-agent-development` - Add or modify an orchestrator agent/node/workflow with schema-first outputs, explicit state, and test coverage.
- `$optimize-performance` - Use when reviewing code for performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
- `$plan-creation` - Create a concrete, executable plan file for large or risky changes.
- `$project-docs-update` - Use when project context, roadmap, or insights must be updated after a change.
- `$project-setup` - Use when a project foundation must be created or updated from a PRD or idea before any feature work.
- `$security-check` - Use when reviewing changes for security risks in auth, data access, and input handling.
- `$test-plan` - Use when you need a comprehensive, repo-consistent test plan for a feature or change.
- `$testing-in-browser` - Capture the canonical steps for starting the dev stack, connecting via MCP DevTools, and iteratively resolving browser errors.
- `$thread-closing` - Close a thread reliably with validation status, documentation updates, and a final summary.
- `$ui-consistency-check` - Use when reviewing UI changes for consistency with the UI and UX baselines.
