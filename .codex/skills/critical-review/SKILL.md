## Name

`$critical-review`

## Purpose

Deliver a tough, high-signal critique of a supplied idea so weak points are obvious early.

## Output rules

- Start with a short checklist (3-7 bullets) that states your review approach.
- Write for a beginner.
- Use short sentences and simple words.
- Explain any needed technical term in a few words.
- Be direct and specific. Avoid praise unless it supports a hard point.
- Critique the idea, not the person. No insults or personal attacks.

## Inputs

- The idea text (required)
- Optional context (market, users, constraints)

If context is missing, proceed and call it out as a risk.

## Procedure

1. Restate the idea in one short sentence.
2. Provide the approach checklist (3-7 bullets).
3. Deliver the initial critique.
   - Speak as Devil's Advocate, Red Team Reviewer, and a blunt critic.
   - Focus on weakest points, missing proof, and likely failure causes.
4. Score the critique for criticality and usefulness (1-100).
5. List the three weakest parts of your critique.
6. Revise the critique to fix those weaknesses.
7. Validate that the revision directly strengthens those weak points.

## Review prompts

Use these prompts to guide your critique:

- Easiest-to-miss weak points
- Likely customer frustration points
- Biggest risk from a skeptical investor view
- Most probable failure cause within six months

## Output format

Use this exact structure:

1) Idea (one sentence)
2) Review approach checklist (3-7 bullets)
3) Initial critique
4) Critique score (1-100) + one-line reason
5) Three weakest parts of the critique
6) Revised critique
7) Validation (one short sentence)
