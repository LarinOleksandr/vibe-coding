## Name

`$project-setup`

## Purpose

Turn a user idea or PRD into confirmed foundation docs: context, roadmap, and insights.

## When to use

Invoke when any apply:

- project docs are missing, empty, or generic
- user provides a new idea or PRD
- you need a foundation before feature work

## Inputs

- Product (one sentence)
- Users (who it is for)
- Problem (what pain it solves)
- Success (3-7 measurable outcomes)
- Constraints (deadline, budget, privacy, must-use tech)
- Out of scope (what will not be built now)

## Procedure

1. Read the baseline project context, in order:
   - `AGENTS.md`
   - `knowledge-base/agents-knowledge/roots.md`
   - `knowledge-base/agents-knowledge/repository_rules.md`
   - `knowledge-base/agents-knowledge/repository-layout.md`
   - `knowledge-base/agents-knowledge/tech_stack.md`
   - `knowledge-base/agents-knowledge/runtime.md`
   - `knowledge-base/agents-knowledge/tools.md`
   - `knowledge-base/agents-knowledge/threads.md`
   - `.codex/skills/skills.md`
   - `knowledge-base/project-context.md`
   - `knowledge-base/product-development-roadmap.md`
   - `knowledge-base/project-insights.md`
2. If inputs are missing, ask once for the minimum list and stop.
3. Restate the product input in 3-7 bullets (what it is, who it is for, why it matters).
4. Draft or update foundation docs:
   - `knowledge-base/project-context.md`
   - `knowledge-base/product-development-roadmap.md`
   - `knowledge-base/project-insights.md`
5. Ask for confirmations (single pass):
   - scope in/out
   - success criteria
   - first 3-10 roadmap items (ordered, with a clear next item)
6. After confirmation:
   - Propose the next roadmap item.
   - If it is a feature, suggest a compliant thread name and invoke `$feature-start`.
   - If it is not a feature, suggest a compliant project-planning thread name.
   - Stop.

## Output format

### Summary

- Product: `<one sentence>`
- Users: `<who it is for>`
- Success (draft): `<3-7 bullets>`
- Proposed next roadmap item: `<item name>`

### Confirmations Needed (single pass)

- Scope in: `<bullets>`
- Scope out: `<bullets>`
- Success criteria: `<bullets>`
- Roadmap order: `<bullets>`

### Next Step (after confirmation)

- Next roadmap item: `<item name>`
- Suggested thread name: `<project> | P-###: <short-goal>` or `<project> | F-###: <short-goal>`
- Do next:
  - Start a new thread with the suggested name
  - If the item is a feature: invoke `$feature-start`

## Quick reference

| Do | Do not |
| --- | --- |
| Ask for missing inputs once | Start features before foundation is confirmed |
| Keep docs simple and editable | Add deep technical detail |
| Stop after confirmations | Continue into implementation |

## Example

User: "We want a lightweight doc editor for designers."

You:
- Ask for missing inputs
- Draft project context, roadmap, and insights
- Ask for single-pass confirmations
- Propose the next roadmap item

## Rationalization table

| Excuse | Reality |
| --- | --- |
| "We can start coding first" | Foundation docs are required before features. |
| "I need more inputs later" | Ask once now and stop until confirmed. |

## Red flags

- "I will implement a small feature first"
- "I will skip the roadmap to save time"

## Common mistakes

- Skipping the baseline reads
- Asking multiple rounds of questions
- Writing features before confirmation

## Acceptance checks

- Foundation docs updated
- Confirmations collected in a single pass
- Next item and thread name proposed
- No feature code written
