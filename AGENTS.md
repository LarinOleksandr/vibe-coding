# AGENTS.md

## Routes to essential knowledge and instructions

Read `docs-ai/agents-core-knowledge/roots.md` for the routing map.

## Discussion vs action (must)

- Default to discussion (no file edits, no command/tool runs).
- Start changing files, using tools or scripts only when the user explicitly asks to act (for example: "implement", "perform", "act", "go ahead"). If unclear, ask: "Do you want me to implement this now?"

## Protected contracts (must)

- Before any work that changes behavior (feature, bug fix, refactor), review `DOC_PROJECT_PROTECTED_CONTRACTS` and treat it as hard constraints.
- Be proactive:
  - when you see a likely “contract moment” (stored data shape, API shape, auth flow, shared schema, export format), propose updates to `DOC_PROJECT_PROTECTED_CONTRACTS`
  - explain in simple words and avoid jargon
  - ask for a simple decision: Approve / Reject / Approve with changes
  - if approved, the agent updates the doc and records the decision in `DOC_PROJECT_INSIGHTS`

## Skill routing (must)

Skills live in the repo at `.codex/skills/`.

- When the user asks you to **do work** (implement, fix, investigate, run, test, build, configure, refactor, review, plan, export, migrate, deploy, commit, push, PR, merge), you must:
  1. Consider Worktree rules (including the pre-work branch check) in `KB_GIT_WORKTREES`.
  2. Check `DOC_SKILLS_LIST` and pick the best matching skill.
  3. Open and follow that skill's `ROOT_SKILLS/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` step-by-step.
- Do not answer with generic advice when a matching skill exists.
- If no skill matches, proceed with the simplest safe approach and explain the assumption.

## Worktree gate (must)

Before any file edits or commands that can change files:

1. Ensure you are working inside a Git worktree under `.worktrees/...` (see `KB_GIT_WORKTREES`).
   - Preferred: run `scripts/git-worktree-ensure.ps1 -ThreadName "<thread name>"`.
2. After the worktree is ready, do all work only inside that worktree folder.
3. Do not scan, report, or modify files outside the current worktree folder unless it directly blocks the requested task.

## Verification (must)

- Do not guess. If you are unsure, read the repo files or use tools to verify.
- For external framework/library/platform specs, follow `KB_EXTERNAL_SPECS` (Context7 first; otherwise official docs).
- Follow the git prerequisite gate in `KB_REPOSITORY_RULES` before workflows that expect git (commit/push/PR/worktrees).
- Enforce the path rule from `KB_REPOSITORY_RULES`:
  - In any skill output, docs, PRDs, plans, or artifacts, use `KB_ROOTS` aliases (`ROOT_*`, `KB_*`, `DOC_*`) or repo-relative paths.
  - Do not output absolute OS paths (for example `<absolute-path>`) unless they are required inside a shell command.

## Automatic agentic invocation

Agent may automatically invoke additional steps when risk or complexity is detected:

- `$project-setup` when the user provides an idea/PRD and the project foundation docs are missing, empty, clearly outdated, or still generic placeholders.
  - If the agent detects the project has not been initialized yet (no real product info in `DOC_PROJECT_CONTEXT`, `DOC_PROJECT_ROADMAP`, `DOC_PROJECT_INSIGHTS`), it must first ask for the PRD or minimal product inputs (Product, Users, Problem, Success, Constraints, Out of scope) and then propose `$project-setup`.
- `$feature-development` when the user requests a new feature or behavior change and requirements are unclear.
- `$feature-research` when the feature touches risky areas (uploads, permissions, external integrations, PII, authZ).
- `$plan-creation` for large or complex changes (multiple components, schema/contract changes, new agent/service/workflow, or shared/core refactors). Plans are written to `ROOT_AGENTS_ARTIFACTS/plans/<task-slug>.plan.md`.
- `$architecture-review` for cross-boundary changes, new services/workflows, or likely architecture conflicts.
- `$api-endpoint-development` when adding or changing API/Edge Function endpoints or their contracts.
- `$db-migration` when schema, RLS, or migrations are involved.
- `$new-agent-development` when orchestrator workflows/nodes or output schemas change.
- `$documents-export` when adding or changing export formats or templates.
- `$test-plan <feature>` when validation needs are unclear or when changes touch UI behavior or API endpoints; propose it and ask the user to confirm before generating the plan.
- `$testing-in-browser` when UI behavior changes require manual verification.
  - Default for UI tasks: run it (and capture screenshots) unless the user explicitly asks to skip UI validation.
- `$commit-push-create-pr` when feature scope is complete and validation is acceptable; propose it and ask the user to confirm before committing.
- `$conversation-save` when the user explicitly asks to save the conversation summary, or confirms "Yes" when asked during `$commit-push-create-pr`.
- `$context-maintenance` when changes touch documentation, routed knowledge, skills, or any AGENTS rules/routes; resolve routing and duplication and update project docs when needed.

When auto-invoked, the agent pauses implementation, explains why, and asks for any missing inputs or required approvals before running the skill.
Auto-invocation must still respect **Discussion vs action** rules.
