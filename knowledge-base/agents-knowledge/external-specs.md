## Agent summary

- Use Context7 as the default, authoritative source for external specs
- Avoid guessing APIs, defaults, or versions

---

## Primary rule

- Use Context7 for framework, library, and platform specifications.
- Treat Context7 outputs as authoritative over model memory.
- Do not rely on undocumented or inferred behavior.

---

## Fallback policy

Use official documentation only when Context7 is unavailable or incomplete.
If sources conflict, surface the conflict explicitly.
