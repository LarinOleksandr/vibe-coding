# Project Insights Log

## [1.1]

- Standardized thread types and codes (`KB_THREADS`) and aligned docs/commands to the canonical format.

## [1.2]

- Added `KB_REPOSITORY_LAYOUT` and wired it into baseline context loads and documentation maintenance so placement guidance stays current as the repo grows.

## [1.3]

- Added a first-class design review workflow: `/design-review` (thread type `DR-###`) and a persisted design review artifact location under `knowledge-base/agents-artifacts/design-reviews/`.

## [1.4]

- Renamed the primary human guide to `docs/application-development-guide.md` and updated references.
